| Model                | MAE    | RMSE   | R¬≤        |

| **chronos-t5-base**  | 53.90  | 57.11  | -2.99 ‚ùå   |
| **chronos-t5-small** | 197.25 | 233.28 | -65.63 ‚ùå  |

Simple Interpretation:<br>
| Metric   | Meaning                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MAE**  | Average size of prediction error (lower is better)                                  |
| **RMSE** | Same as MAE but penalizes large errors more                                         |
| **R¬≤**   | 1.0 = perfect, 0 = no better than mean, **< 0 = worse than predicting the average** |

**Observations**:<br>
- All models have negative $R^2$,

This means: <mark>‚ÄúThe model performed worse than just predicting the average of the training values.‚Äù

- `t5-base` clearly outperforms small and large models:
<br> MAE and RMSE are lowest.

Still not ‚Äúgood‚Äù but better than others.

**Why we are getting this bad result and Future Work**:<br>
| Cause                                | Explanation                                                                                           |

| üî¢ **Small dataset**                 | Chronos is pre-trained, but in our series data we have < 50 points which is not enough context for large models. |
| üí£ **T5-large overfits or diverges** | More parameters $\neq$ better when data is scarce.                                                         |
| ‚öñÔ∏è **T5-base = balanced**            | Enough capacity without overfitting your small context.                                               |
| üéØ **Zero-shot limitation**          | You're not training or fine-tuning ‚Äî so model has to generalize blindly.                              |

Therefore, in future we can work on more data and do some fine-tuning.
